	In August 2001 Lauren and Shaun opened this used book shop in 123 Moorabool street in Geelong. 
	2015 we started opening at 9 a.m.!  We must be the only book shop open at this hour!
	</p>
	<p>We have a range of secondhand books, and selected new ones.</p>  
	<p><span class="highlight">Do you have books to sell?</span> <br />
	We are always on the look out for secondhand books. Do try us if you have any that you no longer require, we may well be interested, for cash or exchange. PLEASE PHONE FIRST, to arrange a convenient time.
